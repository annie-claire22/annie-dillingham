# My name is Annie Dillingham
Currently, I am enrolled in a Digital Humanities course, and that is why I am writing this blog post. I wanted to share a little bit about myself, considering you only know my name and nothing else. I am a senior at Christopher Newport University majoring in English with minors in Literature and Film Studies. The Digital Humanities course was relevent to my Film Studies minor, and it certainly piqued my interest. Prior to taking this course, I knew nothing about digital humanities or really anything related to it. I had no idea that digital humanities was a way to share information or experiences with communities around the world, and after learning, that it made me want to delve into that new and exciting world. I suppose that is one of the things that I love most about being an English major; it feels as if I am constantly learning new things that relate back to English, one of those being Digital Humanities. 
I suppose you might be wondering, why did I choose to be an English major? To most people, it seems like an unruly amount of reading and writing, and they are not wrong about that; however, English is a wide and vast world with innumerable topics to learn about.
