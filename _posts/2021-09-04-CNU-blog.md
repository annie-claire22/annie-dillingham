##CNU Map

For my CNU interactive map, I wanted to share my story about marching band and some of the special moments I have experienced. Each white dot on the map covers a spot on CNU's campus where the marching band has performed or practiced. I have been fortunate enough to be a part of the Marching Captains for all four years of college, and it has been one of the best experiences of my life. I mention this in the map, but before coming to CNU, I had never done marching band before. I had participated in orchestra and small wind ensemble bands, but nothing like an actaul marching band. I was a fairly shy individual when I started college, but the marching band really helped me find myself and my best friends. In this CNU map, I do not specifically focus on one year of my college experience, but rather, I look at my time in marching band from all four years.
