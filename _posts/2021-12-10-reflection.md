## Reflection 
When I first started my Digital Humanities course, I was very unsure of what digital humanities meant in general. Giving a solid definition and spotting a DH project was out of my range. Now, after being in the class for a semester, I feel much more confident about these things. I am able to spot a DH project from one that looks like it could be a DH project but actually is not. To me, DH is combining the digital with something more traditional, like a physical text, and making something that can be shared with a community. I think I have a better understanding of DH in general since we practiced with it throughout the course. 

One of my favorite assignments from this semester was the CNU map assignment. We were able to use a map of CNU's campus and make dots on specific parts of the campus. This was really enjoyable because I had the opportunity to reflect on my time at CNU. As a senior, I have a lot of memories from my time on campus, but I chose to focus on my marching band experience. The image below is a look at the map and where I placed my points. I decided to choose my favorite spots and memories on campus where the marching band has performed or practiced. I enjoyed this project because while I was able to reflect on some amazing memories, I was also learning how to use a great DH platform, and it is definitely something I can use in the future for other courses as well.

An assigment I struggled with the most was the Grant. I mainly struggled with this assignment because it took me a little bit of time to think of a topic that was feasible. Once I figured out what my topic would be, things became much easier. As things did become easier, I did find I had some difficulty with writing the Grant narrative and Environmental Scan for the project. I mainly worried that my writing would not sound professional enough, but I quickly remembered that this was not an actual grant, and as long as I committed to making my writing as formal as possible, it would all come together. Overall, this project was a great learning experience.
