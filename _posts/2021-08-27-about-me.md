## I'm Annie Dillingham and This is My Blog
I wanted to share a little bit about myself, considering you know my name and basically nothing else. My hometown is a quick and relatively painless drive to Suffolk, Virginia. Outside of school, I like to read and go record shopping. Being a vinyl addict certainly has its consequences and leaves me a little broke, but listening to a soft record while I study at school is undeniably a wonderful treat. On a more academic note, I am a senior at Christopher Newport University majoring in English with minors in Literature and Film Studies. Currently I am taking a Digital Humanities course, something that falls within my English major and one of the reasons why I am writing this post dear reader. I suppose you might be wondering, why did I choose to be an English major? To most people, it seems like an unruly amount of reading and writing, and they are not necessarily wrong about that; however, English is a wide and vast world with innumerable topics to learn about. That is one of the things that I love most about my major; it feels as if I am constantly learning new things that relate back to English, one of those being Digital Humanities. 
#Life After CNU
As a senior, I have been doing some serious thinking about what I'd like to do when I graduate. At the moment, deciding whether or not to go to graduate school has been tricky for me. One of my dreams is to become an editor or professor. If I want to follow one of these paths, graduate school would benefit me greatly, but I can't help but feeling unsure and indecisive. I have had a heavy question weighing in my mind as a junor and now senior: _do I want to work a 9-5 job every day?_ Other questions find their way in my mind too. _Can you handle a 9-5 job for the rest of your life?_ _Will life be boring if I choose this career path?_ These questions are consistently floating around in my mind, trying to convince me that maybe I'm choosing the wrong career. I think I am slowly starting to realize that no matter what career I choose, I am never **stuck** with it. 

That is just a peek into my life. As a student writing this short "About Me" blog post, I want to be professional, but also relatable. While I do believe sharing some basic details about myself is important, I think that sharing a snippet of my _real_ college struggle and what goes through my mind would be equally important and valuable as well.
