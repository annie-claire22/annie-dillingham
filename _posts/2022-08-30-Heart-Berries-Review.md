![HeartBerries](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89642987/176762342-f422f26c-fb44-4d01-b7b8-1b55ea03807a.jpg) _Heart Berries_, an emotion provoking memoir by Terese Marie Mailhot, holds nothing back. This is a book that exhibits the raw and vulnerable nature of mental health and just how much it affects daily life. Terese Marie Mailhot, a First Nation Canadian writer, integrates her personal stories and experiences as a part of an indigenous Indian family. She shares her journey of acceptance and discovery without excluding pain and suffering along the way. As a child, she was surrounded by her mother and grandmother, both very in tune with their Indian heritage. From a young age, Terese faced mental health issues, but rather than seeking out professional therapy, her mother and grandmother relied on more traditional practices of healing. She was introduced to healers, the spirit world, and connection to the mind. Healers that frequently visited Terese explained that the sickness in her mind could be related to spirits trying to communicate with her. As she grew older, she outgrew these practices instilled in her by her mother and grandmother, but her mental health struggles remained. This author lets her story tell itself and reminds the reader that although trying times will pass, healing is not linear and sometimes help is necessary. 

_Heart Berries_ reveals the way that mental health can affect life from a young age and into adulthood. Initially, the explicit nature of this book can be shocking, but it sheds light on the taboo subject of mental health. It is evident in the book that Mailhot's declining mental health is correlated to her relationship with her mother. As her mother was often absent, in search of a partner, Mailhot grew up lacking the proper tools to combat the turbulent nature of life. While her mother did attempt to seek healers for Mailhot, the complexity of their relationship grows as her mother was verbally abusive. This verbally abusive behavior centered around her mother's belief that Mailhot would never be successful in finding a partner. 

To fill the gaping void left by her mother's cutting words, Mailhot dated men for material gain, but she was frequently unsuccessful in her love life as her mental health continued to decline. As mentioned by Sherman Alexie in the introduction, _Heart Berries_ bears the power to break the reader down and build them back up again. The way that Mailhot delivers her stylistic choice in writing further emphasizes the power a sentence holds with just a few words. This roller coaster of events accurately depicts how life constantly changes around us, and it is determined by us as individuals how we will adapit to it. A part of this book that perfectly exemplifies the ever-chaning ways of life is Terese's relationship with Casey, a teacher that helped her with creative writing. Their relationship began as an affair, and Terese realized Casey gave her everything she wanted but also everything she despised. In time, it became clear that Terese's rapidly declining mental health could not be ignored, and it began to affect her relationship with Casey. 

At certain points throughout this memoir, it felt somewhat like a journal and a peek into Mailhot's private thoughts. While she could not imagine life without Casey, she acknowledged the fact that she could not heal with him. It seems that there was an emotional barrier between them, and it reached a critical point when Casey could not longer offer any comfort to Terese. Not only does _Heart Berries_ examine rocky parental relationships, it also highlights the detrimental impact poor mental health can have on romantic relationships. Mailhot's choice of narration as she experiences devastating heartbreak between her and Casey allows the reader to feel every emotion at a deep level. Her mental health simply could not be ignored, and although she felt that she could not live without her partner, Terese was in need of healing herself first. 

This memior continues with Terese's journey in a mental health facility, and she switches the narrative for this portion. In her previous narration throughout _Heart Berries_, she states what happens and the consequences that follow, but when Terese is admitted, she decides to capture every moment in the form of a letter to Casey. She desperately tries to prove in her letter that she is worth the effort and love. As Terese endures a painful yet rewarding experience of healing, she often refers back to some Indian practices from her mother and grandmother. In their culture, the first medicine man came to be when he found solace in communicationg with spirits through the dream world. Terese found solace in the fact that she her turbulent and unfulfilling childhood was not her fault. 

Before reaching the end of _Heart Berries_, I often questioned if Terese would have a happy and peaceful life despite her fluctuating mental health. This vulnerable memoir encapsulates a rich message about mental health and life: the things you do in order to heal are not selfish. The stigmas around mental health and self care are challenged throughout this entire book. By creating a vulnerable and raw narrative, Mailhot created a space for readers to safely feels these impossible feelings. She conveyed a message that above all else, mental health matters. Healing and forgiveness look different for everyone, and the journey is rarely rainbows and butterflies. Mailhot does not hold anything back in her writing, and after reading her memoir, I understood that in order to create a safe space for readers, you must be realistic and honest. _Heart Berries_ tells the story of Terese's childhood to adulthood, and this chronological time frame is necessary in order to understand the bigger picture. In such a small book, this memoir presents the reality of life and the choice to accept it or not.
