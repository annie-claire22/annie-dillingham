# My name is Annie Dillingham
Considering you do not really know anything about me, except for my name, let me share a little about myself with you. Currently I am a senior at Christopher Newport Univeristy, and I am majoring in English with minors in literature and film studies. The post you are reading now is related to my Digital Humanities class.
