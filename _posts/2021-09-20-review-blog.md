## **Project:** _Visual Haggard_

### **Project Directors:** Kate Holterhoff and Joe Essey

### **Project URL:** http://www.visualhaggard.org/

#### **Summary**

_Visual Haggard_ is a project that aims to emphasize Rider Haggard’s novels and original illustrations. With the help of Haggard’s biography, the numerous novels and illustrations on the site portray different themes such as violence, South African culture, and love. Haggard’s life was greatly influenced by these different themes. They shaped the way he approached his writing, eventually bringing about the emergence of his literary style. His immersion into South African culture was likely the largest influence in his writing, and inspired the setting, scenes, and characters in the many novels displayed on _Visual Haggard_.

#### **Relevance**

After a quick browse of _Visual Haggard_, I noticed the information was clear about how Rider Haggard’s novels would be illustrated. Not only was the site informative about how the novels would be illustrated in several different ways, it also shared why these illustrations were relevant. In addition to this site revamping and emphasizing Haggard’s illustrations in a new and exciting way, it also seeked to make these original illustrations art pieces themselves, almost independent of the novels but still relevant to the context. Each cover of a novel distincly relates back to Rider Haggard’s biography, which mentions his important literary themes: violence, South African culture, and love.

#### **Design**

_Visual Haggard_ is accessible on a mobile device and laptop, but the mobile version does not portray the illustrations as significantly as the laptop version. Viewing _Visual Haggard_ on a laptop or desktop displays all of the illustrations side by side, allowing for a better experience and understanding of how the artworks connect to each other. On a mobile device, each tab is not easily accessible for the user, but on a laptop, each tab can be seen at the top of the screen and browsed with a simple click.

#### **Findings**

The _Visual Haggard_ website was easy to navigate, and the links connected to the illustrations and novels were very accessible. The opening page of the site is clear with well-placed paragraphs of information on “How To Get Started.” The majority of the artwork and pictures related to Rider Haggard are clustered within the "Illustrators" and "Novels" tab of the project, and while these tabs are enjoyable to browse, the "Biography" and "Editor’s Statement" tabs could have integrated more pictures within the text. A few pictures scattered throughout text would help the large, intimidating paragraphs on the page seem more manageable. 

The "Novels" and "Illustrators" tabs contain beautiful artwork and depictions of Haggard’s novels and stories. Each novel and its cover is accompanied by a short summary and how the cover was created. Similarly, almost every illustration within the "Illustrators" tab is paired with a small description of the illustrator and their related work. These easily accessible images on the _Visual Haggard_ site are wonderful ways to connect imagery and literature with each other. 

The "Biography" tab of Rider Haggard contained rich and valuable information about his life in chronological order and how he came to be a great writer. This section was very informative and beneficial in understanding Haggard’s journey to literary success; however, there were several paragraphs relating to his earlier life that could have been condensed. The load of information about his youth seemed to bury the most important text about his literary career, one of the sole focuses of _Visual Haggard_. The majority of background information on Rider Haggard’s life was important and essential but could have simultaneously been more concise.
