## I'm Annie Dillingham and This is My Blog
I wanted to share a little bit about myself, considering you know my name and basically nothing else. My hometown is a quick and relatively painless drive to Suffolk, Virginia. Outside of school, I like to read and go record shopping. Being a vinyl addict certainly has its consequences and leaves me a little broke, but listening to a soft record while I study at school is undeniably a wonderful treat. On a more academic note, I am a senior at Christopher Newport University majoring in English with minors in Literature and Film Studies. Currently I am taking a Digital Humanities course, something that falls within my English major and one of the reasons why I am writing this post dear reader. I suppose you might be wondering, why did I choose to be an English major? To most people, it seems like an unruly amount of reading and writing, and they are not necessarily wrong about that; however, English is a wide and vast world with innumerable topics to learn about. That is one of the things that I love most about my major; it feels as if I am constantly learning new things that relate back to English, one of those being Digital Humanities. 

### _Life After CNU_
As a senior, I have been doing some serious thinking about what I'd like to do when I graduate. At the moment, deciding whether or not to go to graduate school has been tricky for me. One of my dreams is to become an editor or professor. If I want to follow one of these paths, graduate school would benefit me greatly, but I can't help but feeling unsure and indecisive. I have had a heavy question weighing in my mind as a junor and now senior: _do I want to work a 9-5 job every day?_ Other questions find their way in my mind too. _Can you handle a 9-5 job for the rest of your life?_ _Will life be boring if I choose this career path?_ These questions are consistently floating around in my mind, trying to convince me that maybe I'm choosing the wrong career. I think I am slowly starting to realize that no matter what career I choose, I am never **stuck** with it. 

That is just a peek into my life. As a student writing this short "About Me" blog post, I want to be professional, but also relatable. While I do believe sharing some basic details about myself is important, I think that sharing a snippet of my _real_ college struggle and what goes through my mind would be equally important and valuable as well.

**Summary**

Visual Haggard is a project that aims to emphasize Rider Haggard’s novels and original illustrations. With the help of Haggard’s biography, the numerous novels and illustrations on the site portray different themes such as violence, South African culture, and love. Haggard’s life was greatly influenced by these different themes. They shaped the way he approached his writing, eventually bringing about the emergence of his literary style. His immersion into South African culture was likely the largest influence in his writing, and inspired the setting, scenes, and characters in the many novels displayed on Visual Haggard.

**Relevance**

After a quick browse of Visual Haggard, I noticed the information was clear about how Rider Haggard’s novels would be illustrated. Not only was the site informative about how the novels would be illustrated in several different ways, it also shared why these illustrations were relevant. In addition to this site revamping and emphasizing Haggard’s illustrations in a new and exciting way, it also seeks to make these original illustrations art pieces themselves, almost independent of the novels but still relevant to the context. Each cover of a novel can be seen to relate back to Rider Haggard’s biography, which mentions his important literary themes: violence, South African culture, and love.

**Findings**

The Visual Haggard website was easy to navigate, and the links connected to the illustrations and novels were very accessible. The opening page of the site is clear with well-placed paragraphs of information on “How To Get Started.” The majority of the artwork and pictures related to Rider Haggard are clustered within the Illustrators and Novels tab of the project, and while these tabs are enjoyable to browse, the Biography and Editor’s Statement tabs could have integrated more pictures within the text. A few pictures scattered throughout text would help the large, intimidating paragraphs on the page seem more manageable. 

The Novels and Illustrators tabs contain beautiful artwork and depictions of Haggard’s novels and stories. Each novel and its cover is accompanied by a short summary and how the cover was created. Similarly, almost every illustration within the Illustrators tab is paired with a small description of the illustrator and their related work. These easily accessible images on the Visual Haggard site are wonderful ways to connect imagery and literature with each other. 

The Biography of Rider Haggard’s life contained rich and valuable information about his life in chronological order and how he came to be a great writer. This section was very informative and beneficial in understanding Haggard’s journey to literary success; however, there were several paragraphs relating to his earlier life that could have been condensed. The load of information about his youth seemed to bury the most important text about his literary career, one of the sole focuses of Visual Haggard. The majority of background information on Rider Haggard’s life was important and essential but could have simultaneously been more concise.

**Design**

Visual Haggard is accessible on a mobile device and laptop, but the mobile version does not portray the illustrations as significantly as the laptop version.Viewing Visual Haggard on a laptop or desktop displays all of the illustrations side by side, allowing for a better experience and understanding of how the artworks connect to each other. On a mobile device, each tab is not easily accessible for the user, but on a laptop, each tab can be seen at the top of the screen and browsed with a simple click.

**Credit**

Kate Holterhoff, editor, and Joe Essey, lead developer, pioneered Visual Haggard, seeking to spread scholarly knowledge about Rider Haggard and connect an audience with beautiful illustrations and impactful literature. Holterhoff diligently credits each illustrator and scholar that dedicated their talent and work to portray some of Haggard’s rich stories. Acknowledgements are specifically given to Catherine Golden, Andrew Stauffer, and Dino Felluga as they greatly contributed to and supported the development of Visual Haggard as a whole.
