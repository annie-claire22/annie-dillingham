## **Project:** _The Millions Who Left_

### **Project Director:** Christian Bangel

### **Project URL:** [Zeit Online] (https://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2019-05/east-west-exodus-migration-east-germany-demography?utm_referrer=http%3A%2F%2Fdhawards.org%2F)


#### Relevance 

This DH project aims to clarify what actually happened in Germany after the fall of the Berlin Wall. While there are likely numerous other physical resources for German migration and the fall of the Berlin Wall, Zeit Online compiles a substantial amount of information about everything there is to know about this occurrence in Germany during 1991-2017. It seems that Zeit Online is trying to reach a broader audience about this German migration and wishes to clarify any confusion or inaccuracies.

#### Credit

It appears that Zeit Online was created by a group of people, but the author of this project is Christian Bangel. There are some words throughout the site that are in German, but the majority of this site was translated into English by Charles Hawley. Each name associated with this project is hyperlinked and leads to a separate Zeit Online web page with additional information about that specific person. At the very bottom of the main page, Moritz Klack and Christoph Rauscher are mentioned for their contributions to the project. 

#### Summary

This site aims to inform and educate the public about the heavy migration in Germany from 1991-2017. One of the main points throughout Zeit Online is the fluctuation of people in East and West Germany and how it affected those regions. While one of the larger parts of this project focuses on the pattern of migration and its effects, there is a substantial history about Germany before migration became a more prominent issue within the country. 

#### Findings 

Zeit Online did an excellent job of including vast amounts of information about German migration throughout 1991-2017. The project not only included a history of Germany before heavy migration started, but also it included a sizable amount of statistics, data, and consequences about migration from the east to the west. 

The site itself was well-ordered; rather than beginning with the aftermath and consequences of migration, Zeit Online informed the reader about the beginning of migration, during, and after. The map and graphs placed throughout the main page were incredibly helpful with visualizing and understanding what the main body of text explained on the site. 

The map at the top of the page is beautifully animated, but it would have been helpful to have a total timeline underneath the map. The map was likely intended to click through each year of German migration individually as it gives some information about different cities and towns in Germany. Having a total timeline of the migration would be helpful so that the reader could immediately know how long this issue in Germany occurred, but this is a very minor thing about the map. 

It would have been beneficial to have smaller paragraphs throughout the site, and this would have made the text slightly easier to read. Overall, Zeit Online is a smooth and user-friendly site containing a large amount of information about Germanyâ€™s predicament with migration and emigration. This project should be viewed on a desktop device so that the reader can have a full, rich understanding and experience. 

#### Design

Zeit Online is a very user-friendly DH project and website. While this site did contain a large chunk of text, it was accompanied by beautifully illustrated maps and graphs. The map at the very top of the site demonstrates the migration from the East to the West, and the patterns of the migration change as you click through each year on the map. Zeit Online consists of one main page that you can scroll through and explore. The graphs along the page are constructed in a stand still way so that the graph itself does not move, but as you scroll more information about the graph pops up.
