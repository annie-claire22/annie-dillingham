## Reflection 
When I first started my Digital Humanities course, I was very unsure of what digital humanities meant in general. Giving a solid definition and spotting a DH project was out of my range. Now, after being in the class for a semester, I feel much more confident about these things. 

I am able to spot a DH project from one that looks like it could be a DH project but actually is not. To me, DH is combining the digital with something more traditional, like a physical text, and making something that can be shared with a community. I think I have a better understanding of DH in general since we practiced how to use different types of media throughout the course. 

One of my favorite assignments from this semester was the CNU map assignment. We were able to use a map of CNU's campus and make dots on specific parts of the campus. This was really enjoyable because I had the opportunity to reflect on my time at CNU. As a senior, I have a lot of memories from my time on campus, but I chose to focus on my marching band experience. 

The image below is a look at the map and where I placed my points. I decided to choose my favorite spots and memories on campus where the marching band has performed or practiced. I enjoyed this project because while I was able to reflect on some amazing memories, I was also learning how to use a great DH platform, and it is definitely something I can use in the future for other courses as well.

An assingment I struggled with the most was the Grant. I mainly struggled with this assignment because it took me a little bit of time to think of a topic that was feasible. Once I figured out what my topic would be, things became much easier. 

As things did become easier, I did find I had some difficulty with writing the Grant Narrative and Environmental Scan for the project. I mainly worried that my writing would not sound professional enough, but I quickly remembered that this was not an actual grant, and as long as I committed to making my writing as formal as possible, it would all come together. Ultimately, this project was a great learning experience. 

I loved using Twitter as a way to share ideas with everyone in the class. Before each class period I would submit a tweet, and it really made me reflect on what I had been reading or working on for the class. In a way, having a class Twitter helped me feel a sense of community because I could see what thoughts my classmates had about the reading as well. I am typically too shy to speak in class, so having a platform that allowed me to share my thoughts and questions was a great tool to use. 

When I do a reading for any class the night before, I often forget what thoughts or ideas I want to share with the class, but by using Twitter for this class, I was able to avoid that dilemma. Tweeting about the reading really made me think about what I had read and if I fully understood it. Below is an image of my class Twitter account. As I looked through it, I realized how much I have reflected on over the semester, and that certainly made me realize how much I have learned over the semester.

The readings for this class certainly aided in my understanding of DH. Each reading touched on a different topic or aspect of DH that I was completely unaware of beforehand. The articles that we read were engaging and applied to what we were learning about that week. Most often, we would read an article that related to an upcoming assignment, and this was a great resource to look back on as I worked on a similar DH assignment of my own. 

Overall, this class has been a wonderful experience while at CNU. I learned what DH is and how to use various DH platforms. I feel that I have become both a better writer and reader throughout this class; I was consistently able to practice analyzing texts. I liked that I was able to practice my writing through unique assignments, rather than just writing a paper each time. As I continue through my senior year and graduate next semester, I am grateful to have learned about DH, and I can apply the knowledge and skills I learned to new opportunities that come my way.
